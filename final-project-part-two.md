# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.

This topic is about a very basic need of human being which is food. On this era, there is a lot of people suffer hunger and unfortunatly the number is increasing over the last 10 years. I understood that this issue is complex. A lot of people from different segments should collaborate to solve this problem. However, the story that I want to emphasize here is there is a twist which are a lot of people suffer hunger but there is also a lot of wasted food along food supply chain. Therefore, I think it is a good way to fix this stages.
A new chapter of hope happened that AI was impactful in food supply chain, specifically on-farm stages. This is a good opportunity to extend the success story of AI implementation to the next steps. Therefore, my first targeted audience is technologist. Other things that I considered is the supply chain. AI engineer can develop a model but how the model woul integrate with existing system and how it will optimize the outcome should be discussed with engineers in supply chains. Moreover, supports from policymakers are helpful in aligning this technology with society.

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask.

I identified 3 individuals to interview are an tech student, a professional in supply chain, and a social scientist because I want to know the view from technology feasibility, the implementation in supply chain, and also the social perspectives.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Targeted Audience Clarity  | Who do you think the audience of this story? |
|   Emotional Flow   | How was your feeling while view and read this article? |
|   Data viz effectiveness   | Any data viz that hard to interpret? |
|   Call to action Clarity   | What do you think the audience would do next? |
|   Next Improvement   | Any suggestions to improve how the story being told? |


## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

| Questions               | (Tech student, mid 20s) | (Lawyer, mid 30s)| (Supply Chain Engineer, late 30s) |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Who do you think the audience of this story? | Policymakers, Individuals, Computer science researchers/ data scientist/ ML engineers|high educated individuals, engineers| Farmers, agriculture industries, student, government institution - Agriculture Ministry, logistic/Supply Chain company |
| How was your feeling while view and read this article?| Felt depressed and sad at the beginning. A bit shocked on food wasted potential. At the end felt hopeful since there's solution and people are working to solve this problem|very dark at the beginning but optimistic in the end| It made me awake and more aware on current bad hunger situation. Feels enthusiastic about how far AI could help to improve it|
| Any data viz that hard to be interpreted? |'The twist' graph was confusing that one slice of pizza represent how many food and one person icon represent how many people too. But while hovering the cursor it was clear. 'AI' color is not consistent| Asked about the graph of hunger cycle and increased crop production credibility |With AI help's, farmers are able to grow 30% more food - whats are the assumptions made here|
| What do you think the audience would do next? | Policymakers: create regulation, Individuals: dont waste food, Data Scientist/ML engineers: apply/ optimize AI to solve this issues | not sure about what is the next steps. The message is not pretty straightforward |Do more compherensive study to recheck n validate what AI could help, and the investment required|
| Any suggestions to improve how the story being told? | Breakdown those 3 AI initiatives into bullet points, instead of using narrative/ paragraphs | Give the possible impacts of AI implementation to be more persuasive. Add the source of all data viz to show the credibility |Simple video may help to show how AI could play important role to help the farmers as the "producer".. It seems AI will give more benefit only to industrial sector|

# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.
