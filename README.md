# About me
Hi!  I am Agnes. Currently, I am a MISM-12 student in CMU. I have been working for 8 years before in banking and I figured out that Data Visualization is one of must-have skills in work. So here I am learning DataViz in Telling Stories With Data course.

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn how to visualize data effectively through conceptual and practical ways. I am not a design person, so I need a fundamental guidelines about DataViz. I also want to learn tableau as one of DataViz tools.

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.
