# About me
Hi!  I am Agnes. Currently, I am a MISM-12 student in CMU. I have been working for 8 years before in banking and I figured out that Data Visualization is one of must-have skills in work. So here I am learning DataViz in Telling Stories With Data course.

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn how to visualize data effectively through conceptual and practical ways. I am not a design person, so I need a fundamental guidelines about DataViz. I also want to learn tableau as one of DataViz tools.

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
This is my first assignment in this course. I used the real government data and built my first data viz using tableau.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
I learn how to critique of the existing data visualization. Then I learned to re-design the data viz here.

## Final project
Lastly, I did a data viz final project which started from making outline story, sketching, gathering dataset, inputing them all in public space (shorthand). I log the process on this:
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
I also built storyboards and did user research to enrich my data story by inerviewing relevant people. Here's I documented that process: 
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Using those feedbacks from interviews, I adjusted things and made my data story better. Here's my final turn: 
[Part III](final-project-part-three)
