# The final data story

Here's my data story on Shorthand:

# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

I did all the suggestions from my interviews and instructor's advices, as follow:
I enhanced the twist graph with clearer data label and scale
I added some citations of the hunger graph AI success story on-farm
I added AI success story on-farm with citation of the research
I added video of AI on-farm to give clearer visualization
I brokedown the AI future opportunities 
I added call to action for technologists by giving some options how we can start on the new section 'Get Involved'

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

The targeted audience is technologist, specifically in AI, Agricultural, and Supply chain engineering. Based on interviews information, all of them caught the targeted audience corretly while I was asking about it. So that, I think my targeted audience is clear but some supporting information should be added related to the call to action.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

I choosed the twist graph using pictogram since it is fun to visualize the comparison between hungers and food losses by icons. I hope it help the audience understand in just a second. I also chosed the dark color tone on the beginning of the story since I want to make a scary feeling to the audience. Then, I changed the background color brighter when I tell the story of the new hope from AI implementation. I hope by choosing this colors, the audience emotions will be the same as my story arc at Project Part I.
I also learned that not all people are interested by only seeing the data viz but also need clearer real example, such as video. I understood that thing so I decided to embed a video that related to the topic. Inspite of that, I was struggling with making a clear call to action that should also persuasive, but I got the idea to find it as simple as asking where the audience would start from. This is interesting. So that, I came up with some real options that can be followed by technologist to fight hunger.

# Final thoughts

Parts that made me run out time were searching the related dataset and understanding the data viz tools. Sometimes it was hard to find a story behind the data and tailoring up all the data into one. And sometimes it was hard too to visualize the data by tools to be the same as what I wish to design or in my (not so) creative mind. Probably next time I want to take a look deeper on how using Tableau. I think this tool is the most powerful one, but it is more difficult to mastering than datawrapper. I am excited to learn several data visualization tools here and how to tell the story behind. I think this knowledge will be very helpful for me reaching upper managerial level in workplace
