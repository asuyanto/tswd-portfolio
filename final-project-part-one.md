# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 

The primary objective of this project is to understand the powerful impact that data analytics can have in the battle against hunger. Achieving zero hunger is one of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, a target that requires the collaboration of all sectors. My personal interest lies in data analytics, and I am keen to explore how it can contribute to solving this issue, specifically identifying the areas where analytics can play a significant role.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

I will start with the background of the dramatic increase in hunger and undernourishment over the years. I aim to stress the urgency of addressing hunger by explaining the frightening cycle of hunger that could impact future generations. I also plan to show the audience the areas most affected by hunger with a heatmap that highlights these regions. In addition, I want to focus on the contradicted idea of food loss/ waste in regions that suffer the most from hunger, specifically looking at where the waste occurs along the food supply chain. I will then provide a broader view of food loss and waste on a global scale to identify which stages need more attention. The two graphs suggest that most food loss occurs between the post-harvest and consumption stages. I will discuss how data analytics can optimize each stage of the food supply chain to help reduce food loss. With this, I call on data analysts to use data-driven insights to decrease food losses, especially in the post-harvest and distribution stages, and I recommend the general public to cut down on our food waste during the consumption stage.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 

I am going to use Tableau and Shorthand for this project deliverables. I probably insert my own graphs over there.
